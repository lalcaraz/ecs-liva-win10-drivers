
Please follow the steps below to generate the driver package.

1.	Copy the general MBI driver package to a folder.
2.	Put mup.xml in the root of the general driver package you copied in step 1.
3.	Run mbi_create_mup_package.bat <folder_name>. For example, mbi_create_mup_package c:\mbi_mup. 

The script file will convert the general driver package directly to meet MUP 2.4.3 requirements.
